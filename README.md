## Kaggle Knowledge Repository

A personal learning hub for machine learning, data science, and Kaggle competitions.

Welcome to Kaggle Knowledge, a curated collection of notebooks, experiments, and learning materials I develop while improving my machine learning skills through Kaggle competitions and hands-on projects.

This repository serves three main purposes:

### 1. Learning

A structured space where I practice:

Data preprocessing & cleaning

Feature engineering

Model building (RandomForest, XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.)

Cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning

Kaggle submission pipelines

### 2. Experimentation

Each notebook focuses on exploring:

Different modeling strategies

Alternative feature engineering ideas

Error analysis & model interpretation

Methods to improve leaderboard scores

### 3. Knowledge Tracking

As I learn new techniques, I document:

What worked

What didn’t

Why certain models behave differently

Key insights from competitions

This makes it easier to revisit and apply methods across future projects.

Each competition gets its own folder containing Modeling notebooks (baseline → advanced)

### 4. Tools & Technologies

This repository primarily uses:

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM

Matplotlib / Seaborn


By maintaining this repository, I aim to:

* Build a strong understanding of ML modeling workflows
* Master Kaggle competition techniques
* Develop reproducible machine learning pipelines
* Track improvement over time
* Prepare for real-world data science and ML engineering work
